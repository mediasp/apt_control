 - daemon mode, get it running as a init.d controllable daemon
 - debian packaging with private gem dir (let's ugprade to bundler-1.2)
 - jabber bot can dump apt state
 - build-archive will keep a lot in memory as archive gets big - not sure if a
   problem or not, but could work off disk
 - debian version segment is sorted alphabetically, but debian versions have
   special sort ordering that I have completely ignored
